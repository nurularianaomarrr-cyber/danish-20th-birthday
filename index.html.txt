It's almost been a year since we first met, and u willingly changed so much for the better... No words can describe how proud I am of you my love. Now, you're one step closer to your dream, you got into spf! Alhamdulilah.. This journey is going to be long for the both of us, but InsyaAllah, we'll achieve our goals together, build our studies and careers together so that we can build a peaceful future together.. Amin.. Aminkan sayang! My love, no matter how hard things get, none of us are walking away okay? We've changed so much as a couple over the year, all because we're willing to work towards the future we want, and none of us will be giving up so easily okay? My love, you will always be in my prayers, and I always pray to be your future wife. My love towards you is genuine and forever, and I hope the same way goes to you. You're 20 now, but will always be Babyboy in my eyes. Come to me when times get rough, and i'll do everything to comfort and be there for my sweet boy. No one ever can replace you and take your place, and I can confidently sumpah on that. It's us against the world forever! To many more years of growing with one another, InsyaAllah... I love you infinity and always🤎
